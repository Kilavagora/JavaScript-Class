# Class F

## Assignments

1. (5 pts) Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). Install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/getting-started) globally. Configure your editor to use your workspace eslint settings. Review your past assignments to check eslint errors.
2. (7 pts) It has been reported that [Sticky notes demo app](https://stickynotesdemo.herokuapp.com/) has a bug. When clicking inside a note and then clicking out, even when the content is not updated, it makes unnecessary PUT requests. Using Chrome's debugger, find the cause. Use local overrides to fix it. Create a patch file from your fix and commit to your assignments branch.
