# Class 4

## Assignments

1. (5 pts) Write a loop that runs from 0 to 100 inclusive, displays "Fizz" if the number is multiple of 3, "Buzz" if it is multiple of 5, "FizzBuzz" if it is multiple of both 3 and 5 and the number otherwise.
2. (13 pts) Define a function that takes an integer as an argument and returns true if the argument is a prime number and false otherwise. Write a loop that displays numbers from 1 to 100 inclusive and whether it is a prime (i.e. 1 false, 2 true, 3 true and etc.).

## Homework

1. (5 pts) Define a function that returns true if its argument is a palindrome, otherwise returns false. The function should work for strings and numbers. Verify the function with a few random examples and display the results.
2. (7 pts) Write a function that takes two integers and returns their product. The product should be calculated with a loop using only addition.
3. (5 pts) Write a loop that displays squares of the integers from 0 to 100 inclusive (i.e. 0, 1, 4, 9 and etc.).
4. (3 pts) Do above, but instead of multiplication use the function defined in 2.
5. (23 pts) Do above, but use only a single loop and addition. Do not use multiplication or any helper functions for exponentiation.

P.S. Create the separate files for each assignment and homework. Create two branches, one for assignments and one for homework. Push your changes to the corresponding Github branches. Create pull requests to your master. You can use sample.html as a template. echo function defined in helper.js file will display results in the html.
