# Class E

## Assignments

1. (3 pts) In index.html add two simple click event listeners, those just log which one gets triggered, to the #grandparent.
2. (5 pts) Add the similar logging click event listener to the #child also. Reverse the order of logged messages by enabling capture, so that the message from the child will go last.  
3. (7 pts) Allow form submission in form.html only if it has valid entries, passwords match and the checkbox is checked.

## Homework

1. (7 pts) Display the corresponding errors for the form above inside the alert box and add class is-invalid to the input to highlight the inputs with errors.

P.S. Create the separate files for each assignment and homework. Create two branches, one for assignments and one for homework. Push your changes to the corresponding Github branches. Create pull requests to your master.
